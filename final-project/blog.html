        <h2>To Start from Dessert 🍮</h2>
        <p>
          A distance of 5,500 kilometers burdens us Chinese with thousands of ways to draw a distinct line between North and South. But I, inspired by the weekend breakfast arguments between my northern father and southern mother, discovered something small but powerful that symbolizes this cultural divide: tofu.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father's salty, spicy Douhua and my mother's honeyed tofu pudding became metaphors for their values. As a child, I leaned into my father’s fiery rationality, signing up for marathons and debating euthanasia laws. But my mother’s emotional gentleness — encouraging me to become a student counselor and community volunteer — reminded me of the sweet side of life. This is the taste of my home: bold, kind, and contradictory in harmony.
